# Say hi to Buggy

### *Buggy* is a ***bug***. No one knows what kind of ***bug*** *Buggy* is, but *Buggy* is a ***bug***

### *Buggy*'s favorite *color* is **not** `blue`. It ***is***, however, kind of `yellow`.

### Is there some sort of meaning to *Buggy* that perhaps I am not telling y**o**u? I guess y**o**u have to find out. I don't know if *Buggy* wants y**o**u to find *Buggy* but here is a rare image of [*Buggy* the ***bug***](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17pbcpGFye3plvmwDixXkNRK9DIEnitMxfBC-OyIfjzk/edit?usp=sharing).

###### By the way
###### This is a top secret website *Buggy* doesn't know about. If *Buggy* the ***bug*** ever finds out that I made a (poorly designed) website, he'd probably ``` dang it i forgot ```
